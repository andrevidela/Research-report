# Ideas

General ideas about where and how to take the research further

## Use levitation for optimising buffer reads

Make `Vect n a` go fast (and indexing a list with an `Elem` go fast too)

## Use linear annotation to replace "dot-erasure" on type constructors

Has it been done?

## Automatic reference counting using linear/graded modal types

I mean they're the same thing aren't they? If they arent, isn't there a way to 
go from one to the other?
