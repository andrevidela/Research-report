- [x] Attending Pgr presentations

- [x] run examples for IdrisLib
  - had to add a bunch of `--allow-capitalized-pattern-variables` options in makefiles
  - run `make all` in `SequentialDecisionProblems/examples`
  - `./example1` with input `5` `5` already takes forever
  - Looks like the examples weren't ported to Idris 2 mhhhh
  
- [ ] write runtime programs from haskell and scala benchmarks
  - port prime sieve
  - port fibonacchi
  - port vector sum
  - string concatenation

too sick to do anything

I guess I read "clowns to the left jokers to the right" by McBride

## 10

- [ ] test the benchmarks by Nicola
- [ ] read about fibrations
- [x] watch this Microsoft research talk about lean (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp-mQ3HxgDE)
  - No mention of Agda or cubical type theory, might be interesting to compare lean with cubical agda, specialy in terms of quotients
- [ ] finish implementing Fibonacci etc
