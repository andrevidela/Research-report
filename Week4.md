- [x] finish bitwise mutiplication
 - [x] implement in idris 2
 - [x] see if I can introduce linear annotations
   - sort of but they don't seem to be doing anything I should add more and 
     make another version which has a lot of them and another one with very few
     
Gave up on Karatsuba, it's too error prone and it's not directly related to the
thesis, I'll kee the basic addition functions and use those as benchmark. They
should be enough to showcase when linearity matters or not.

## 22

- [ ] start looking into how to reclaim memory when a linear value has been 
      pattern matched on.
