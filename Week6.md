 # 4
 
 - [ ] finish reading walder's paper on linear types
   - started implementing this mess

# 5 
- [ ] started working on metric spaces textbook
  - started implementing examples in Idris
- attending talk from Jan de Muijnck @jfdm. Notes:
  - not using free SMC
  - using linear to model the fact that you can't plug a cable twice
  - constrained version of verilog constructs


# 9

Tried to replace `RigCount` to an abstract `Semiring` but it didn't
work very well, there were a lot a pattern matching on `Rig0` and
`Rig1`. Probably fixable with a view but it's too much work for not
very much payoff. It might also increase compilation time by a lot

# 10

- [ ] implement levitation in Idris
- [ ] work a bit on statebox typedefs
- [ ] work a bit on idris-ct and attempt to implement at nice API overlay
- [ ] progress on neutal networks
